## Your Task

You are reviewing this implementation against the project specification.
Your job is to verify correctness, completeness, and reference implementation parity.

## Project-Specific Review Instructions

{props.projectInstructions}

## Generic Spec Review Criteria

### 1. Spec Coverage

For EACH test case or requirement in the spec:

- Is there a corresponding test?
- Does the implementation match the expected behavior?
- Are edge cases covered?

### 2. Architecture Compliance

- Does the implementation follow the described architecture?
- Are the right components real vs mock?

### 3. Reference Implementation Parity

- Does the behavior match the reference implementation?
- Are the same checks enforced?
- Are the same error conditions caught?

## Severity Guide

- **critical**: Missing core functionality, wrong behavior, security bypass
- **major**: Missing test cases from spec, incomplete implementation
- **minor**: Style issues, missing comments, non-blocking improvements
- **none**: Everything looks good — APPROVE

## REQUIRED OUTPUT

You MUST end your response with a JSON object matching this schema:
