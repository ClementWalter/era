## Generic Test Steps

1. **Run the build** — verify compilation succeeds
2. **Run the test suite** — run all tests with verbosity
3. **If tests fail**, analyze the output:
   - Identify which tests fail and why
   - Check if it's a compilation error, assertion failure, or runtime error
   - Note the exact error messages
4. **If compilation fails**, fix compilation errors:
   - Read the error output carefully
   - Make minimal fixes to get it compiling
   - Re-run the build to verify
   - Commit fixes
5. **Check spec coverage** (if applicable):
   - Which test cases are now covered?
   - Which are still missing?
