# RESEARCH PHASE — {props.phaseName}

Phase ID: {props.phaseId}

## Objective

Gather all reference material needed to implement this phase.
Write your findings to `{props.outputPath}`.

## Phase Description

{props.phaseDescription}

## Project-Specific Instructions

{props.projectInstructions}

## Generic Research Steps

1. **Read any spec/PRD documents** referenced in the instructions above
2. **Read each reference file** listed. For each file, note:
   - Function signatures and their parameters
   - Key logic / business rules
   - Error conditions and revert messages
   - How the reference implementation handles the behavior
3. **If referenced**, read the test spec tree for applicable test cases:
   - List every test case leaf that applies to this phase
   - Note the expected behavior for each test case
4. Only if the above did not provide enough information, run scout subagents to gather additional information.
5. **Write a context document** to `{props.outputPath}` containing:
   - Interface signatures to implement
   - Key behavior from reference implementations
   - Test cases from spec tree (if applicable)
   - Important implementation details
   - Open questions or ambiguities
6. **Commit** the context file

## REQUIRED OUTPUT

You MUST end your response with a JSON object matching this schema:

{props.schema}
