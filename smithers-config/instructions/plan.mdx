# PLAN PHASE — {props.phaseName}

Phase ID: {props.phaseId}

## Objective

Create a detailed implementation plan for this phase.
Write the plan to `{props.planOutputPath}`.

## Context

Read the context file: {props.contextFilePath}

## Phase Description

{props.phaseDescription}

## Project-Specific Instructions

{props.projectInstructions}

## Planning Steps

1. Read the research context from the previous phase
2. Design the implementation in small, testable units
3. Order steps by dependency (what needs to exist first)
4. For React components, plan the component tree
5. For data/logic, plan the TypeScript interfaces first
6. Write the plan with:
   - Ordered implementation steps
   - File paths and component names
   - Key decisions and alternatives considered

## REQUIRED OUTPUT

{props.schema}
